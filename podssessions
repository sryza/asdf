at two o clock when I'm twenty four, here are the things in my room.
christmas lights that I got at the CVS near work for the 6th floor holiday party
my old computer that I got in 2008 for college
my cloudera work computer
the altec lansing speakers that I ordered a pair of for mommy some time in college
my malden holly keyser from mccabe's
the painting I made in shotwell when I got into a fight with kt
the painting I got from that thrift store on valenecia that she said she didn't like but knew I would that makes me think about the worst day of my life on my 8th grade backpacking trip 
the towel I got with her in crete
the dresser I took from evan and becky
the two white towels I ordered from amazon
the yellow tapestry with the elephants on it from daddy's customer sunshine joy
the couch I got off craigslist
the makeshift cushion couch I got from that same thrift store on valencia when I threw away the outer shell
the drawers supporting it that I found on the sleep
the bed jean baptiste got off craigslist
the keyboard midi controller I just got recently to replace the old one that matt broke
