it's absurd to have a floor lamp near trees
or a painting near a painting
it's not enough to have plants on your stoop
or a rope by your window
or plants by your faucet
milk in your guitar
bags of grapes

it's enough to have four-color christmas lights,
the crete towel, the unlit lamp with the shirt on it,
the guitar spread-eagled, the manzanita branch, the neck hairs,
the elephant tapestry
