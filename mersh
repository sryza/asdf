I am at the park in Tucson, Arizona, and Dale is complaining that his pants are wet from all the drops of water that have gathered on the grass. I nod to him in agreement, and then at the sprinklers, and stoned young ruffians on the swing set near the edge of the park.  They are reaching for the moon.

Bon tells me that streetlights and traffic lights are different in every part of the world, and that I should not worry.  But the SUV and the sedan are pulling up, drowning the night with their headlights and squealing tires and that cheap marijuana from across the border that over here they call mersh.  The SUV is selling a few grams to the sedan, and there are no streetlights on this street.  Even the houselights are turned off.

I am waking up in Providence as many people at once, and we are conversing about the impenetrable dark, and the pillow, and whether or not to abandon our insanity to get up and empty our bladder.  We don't want to bring our blanket, so we are dreaming for the desert where the traffic lights are shaped like squares.

A passenger in the desert, I am contemplating how long the thorns stay on a dead cactus, and Dan wakes me up from my meditation.  How could you let people do this in your house? he says, and I tell him that I sometimes join them, and that it won't be so long to the edge of the park, and at this point Dan is ignoring me, staring out the window to count the spines on the cactus, but I continue that he shouldn't worry, because there are still trees in Tucson, even though the yards bear cacti instead of grass to save water, even though the marijuana has seeds in it and goes $10 for an eighth, even though the streetlights are different, different than they are in every other part of the world.
