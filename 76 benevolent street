Zach is putting on his gray suit for the third time today and straightening his collar and tying his tie and smoothing out all the frills and the ripples while
Matt is shoving pencils into his pocket protector before starting the day
On the table is fresh toast and orange juice and a slice of butter alone on a plate
ready for spreading

At the top of the day they have come back and Zach is loosening his necktie while Matt switches on the Colbert report
“hallowed these days” buzzes the TV buzzes the rush against the neck
the same butter is on the plate and I’ve been home to sort through the laundry and look at the dishes

Zach crosses his arms and starts up about other spellings of his name and Matt is closed and I am just trying to carve a design into this cabinet 

The clack of boots against floor and leather against cabinet,
Zach lets out a sigh before the snoring starts and I rush to the table and smash life into the butter
