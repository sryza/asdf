You flicked open the screen door with only one or two fingers;
I thought what a simple act of power, and the air
outside was warm and humid.  Breezes stroked the dirt
on our bare feet, and we treaded carefully
to avoid the sticky sap coating the porch's wooden slats.
When we kissed under the mosquitos, our palms clasped, sweaty.

Your mom said a storm was coming, and the wind agreed,
rustling the mushy bark in the trees, so we went inside
to fill ourselves with soft bread and hummus.
We made it back out for the slow rain, and your shirt
clung sticky to your soft shoulders.
