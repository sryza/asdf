there are fewer woodpiles at the outskirts
Monrovia, Arcadia
on any day
out of town
the 15 is long to Las Vegas
 
scupper on the citywall and a strobelight,
they tended to gather at the outskirts,
Claremont, Ontario, their broomsticks tended
to bunch their skirts
 
I didnâ€™t come here with them,
sipping on strobelights as if I had a broomstick,
I grew up on the inskirts, sanded rough blocks into ovals
 
in Gardena, Pasadena,
they snapped branches into equal lengths,
lay them on the outskirts
the leftover twigs made a skeleton for the tinder
they tended to gather near the gallows
 
I made it past the outskirts on a broomstick
past the ovals, past the woodpiles,
past the gallows
the 15 is long to Las Vegas
