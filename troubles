all our troubles are a pinprick, a snip of yarn right near us
I said it when I was walking on cracked cement and when I was sitting on the couch
a heavy smudge or a drop of water near the neck on a cold morning
 
other people have more troubles
for example, they got hit by a truck or a baseball bat
heavy water or cold smudges on cold mornings
