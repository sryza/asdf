I speak of evil urges
but what I really mean is that today I woke up
and was still in a dream until lunch time
when it popped
I knew the motivations for everything
I was a cheek creasing into a dimple
I was a snowflake stepping off a cloud
 
I mean that everything broke
that I was the traveller and the wasteland
the crooked trees and the gnarled boulders
and the form was fine, the vultures are just animals, the trees are crooked because they grew that way
but I mean evil, not the urges,
just evil through and through
