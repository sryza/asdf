Anyway, everything that you’re saying means nothing to me
I don’t care about laundry
I don’t care about speckled hens
I woke up at 8 pm on a school day
I had a dream that everybody knew python
that my arms were wrapped around my one true love
and she liked it, even though she was with someone else

Anyway, summer isn’t summer sisters aren’t sisters
I don’t live close to anything
I don’t need a laundromat
I sat out of the game today
I had a thought that I could choose the game
but this time a game chose me called
summer isn’t anything
