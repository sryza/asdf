I yelled out gentle,
these are truly the only pants I care for
then felt bad about it
and for myself about the pants
as I stared at the elephant
I got last year next to the fish amphora I made in seventh grade
this house purely is proof that you can't just put enough
things together to make something
and that the words on the page won't pop
out if the page is stuck in a drawer or soaked in the dryer
