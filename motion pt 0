Motion makes you cold
Trees are good and grass is bad
Sitting is slow
People don’t see you
You can’t talk to people outside the window
 
 
We are all good all of the time
            that time you hugged me on the shoulder
            that time you drove me in your car
            that time I drove myself into the palisades
                        there are even people that live in bright big houses in the highlands
                        the gutters were wide and I was good again forever
 
The places that we will go to after that
            all of the time we are good, all of the time we are variations on a form
 
Then how long? What places? Go to them after, go to them?
