you’ll make it because you are strong now
 
think of hills that go up and crosses on rocks
and burrs on socks
and poison oak in the winter
when the leaves are gone
and it looks like other plants
with the leaves gone
 
the rocks are mossburgers
the hills are mushy and covered in poison oak
the air is summer now
you have made it because you are large,
you are strong because you are handsome
 
public restrooms
damaged enamel and combinatoric humor and water balloons
showers turning hotter with the twilight
dirt running from your feet
shiny minerals left between the veins
you’re no scrub, you’re a bather or a swimmer
 
september
furrows the brow
turns glances down streets
the fall sits heavy
paves the hills with rain, makes sweat shine in the lamplight
pushes clouds across the sky
 
after that you’re strong
think of gray grass waving or moss sculptures
what you left salty on the rocks
poison oak without the leaves again
think of hills that go up
when you reach the top the sun’s already set but there’s pink over the mountains
