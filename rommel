I just discovered Erwin Rommel and the clocks are ticking in the basement.  I have no basement but for three decks of playing cards.  I am a warrior star in late September.

Fiery disks are floating up from the door of the basement.  Erwin Rommel is walking in the desert with his black cross.  He is playing DJ with the sand while the stars crush his tanks into a pulp.

Erwin Rommel is in my basement.  He is playing with the water cooler and the deck of cards.  He is drumming his fingers on the clocks. He is staring past the door and thinking of the stars.
