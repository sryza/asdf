every day,
more
I am a projection of
matter onto mind
 
every day more with me
it is like when you move a tree branch in a peat bog
the branch moves, the peat moves twice
with it then against it
 
moving is easy
moving is easy
loving is terrible
moving is easy
moving is terrible
loving is easy
 
on other days
I used to be wet wind
it leaves the tree branch in place but rots it
wet wind whips peat
 
on every other day I hang the wet wind out to dry
I know
when I drape it over a tree branch
moving is easy and loving is easy but motion is terrible
