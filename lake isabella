whether a moment is sheerly a divisible
or sheerly indivisible I don't know, but it
is one of the two

every moment I mean, like all the flatness in Lake Isabella
the town not the lake
like Lake Isabella Way, that cuts through a line in the flatness
lines aren't flat, but Lake Isabella Way must be flat

I mean that moment must have been divisible
Lake Isabella Way near the highway,
Lake Isabella Way near the lake
divisible even into the part before the gas station and the part after the gas station

no it wasn't divisible that moment with the flatness,
it was really just a speck on the dashboard exiting the highway,
maybe another speck later at the intersection near the gas station
it was the streaks of green and white on the red white mountains
not the kind that look like they'll fall over and reveal their flatness and god will be lounging behind there maybe a little embarrassed maybe embering a j
but like one end of a green streak could be closer than another one
like they'd have the same shape when looking at them from the lake
it was the jagged arc their arcs cut into the sky
not any single jags just extended jagness

and of course the other specks with the churches
with the old fences
with the new machine that takes the credit cards
with Comfortably Numb on stereo
with freedom and open spaces and all the other things that are probably real but need some equivocation

still flatness must be divisible, because
it's less like peaks more like
jagged arcs
