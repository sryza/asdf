The city is 50 miles in radius
and a shallow mountain
we all of course live on the slopes
I somewhere near 5 miles in
but the streets are named not numbered
so I as I walk back home at the end of the night
from maybe 10 miles out
I have no idea how close I am
and each block I ascend
for 40 paces I watch my feet thump concrete
and then look up
on what slope is the
next set of three story victorians
internal stairs
mailboxes behind gates
what decorations will be on this tree
is this my street

in my room I will look out and see fog
but it will just be the fog on the glass
