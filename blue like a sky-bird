The sky was deep blue and cloudy in different places;
we stumbled down Robertson Boulevard where
the trees cut bulgy cracks into the sidewalk,
and the cars roll by in blurs.  I lit up a cigarette 
in your mind, which sent your soft little
hands reaching for my body.  My appendages,
dense and skinny, and our blood-white shirts.
The cement was coffee to our lips.

Our bloody lips, our broken teeth,
of course you saw the bus coming, but I prefer
the way things actually happened (you didnâ€™t
warn me).  Lying on blue bird sheets half an hour later,
I think the light finally made it into the room,
so I pushed your pillow off me, delicately,
and sat up.
